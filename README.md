# Food Hygiene Ratings
CO539 Assessment 2 

## Introduction
For this assessment, I used `jQuery` and `AJAX` to make a dynamic webpage that communicates with 2 server-side scripts, and `Boostrap 4` for CSS. The initial page will gather restaurants in Medway from the first page from the server when it loads. The paginator allows you to navigate through the database, and a search bar is loacted at the bottom of the page that allows you to search for specific restaurants.
